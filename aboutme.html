       Hello I'm</span>
    <h1>Angel Medina</h1>
    <h2>Neumont Student</h2>
    <p id="me">I'm a student at Neumont College of Computer Science, where I'm delving into the exciting world of technology and computer science. <br> When I'm not immersed in my studies, you can often find me engrossed in a captivating book, indulging in the latest anime series, strumming away on my guitar, or engaging in lively card games.  <br>As the oldest brother of two siblings, I take pride in being a supportive and caring role model for my family of five. <br> At home, I share my space with two delightful dogs and a captivating array of five reptiles, which add a unique and fascinating dynamic to our household.</p>  
    <p id="me"> I have a diverse set of interests and experiences. <br> For one, I have an impressive collection of over 700 cards, which reflects my passion for collecting and perhaps a deep knowledge of specific subjects. <br> Additionally, I bear a unique scar on my left eyebrow, a testament to a childhood adventure or mishap that has become a part of my personal story. On top of that, I possess some culinary skills, as I have dabbled in the art of cooking. <br> These varied aspects of my life make for a colorful and intriguing combination of hobbies and experiences.</p>
